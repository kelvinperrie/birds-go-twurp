# birds-go-twurp

continuous integration with master/dev branch:

https://birdsoundsci.netlify.app/


To do:

* Fix the problem with sounds not looping properly (gap between end and start)
* Make so sounds only load when requested to be played?
* Check attributions & licenses are accurate
* More birds, more presets  
* Fav icon, all the meta tag stuff
